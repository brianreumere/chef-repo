There was a wall. It did not look important.<br />
It was built of uncut rocks roughly mortared.<br />
An adult could look right over it, and even a child could climb it.<br />
Where it crossed the roadway, instead of having a gate<br />
it degenerated into mere geometry, a line, an idea of boundary.<br />
But the idea was real.<br />
It was important.<br />
For seven generations there had been<br />
nothing in the world more important than that wall.
